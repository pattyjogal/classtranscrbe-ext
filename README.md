# ClassTranscribe Extension

Long story short: there are some features we'd love to see in ClassTranscribe, but making changes
upstream was too much work (for me, at least) at this time. This is a nice temporary solution for
those of use who watch lectures on the site, and want things like remembering your position in the
playlist, and autoplay!

What's in the box:
 - A Firefox extension
 - (Soon TM) A Chrome extension

Contributions are _more_ than welcome, including code cleanup, feature additions, or bug fixes.

# Download
If you want to just get the extension, head to the [Releases](https://github.com/pattyjogal/classtranscrbe-ext)
page. For Firefox, you can just run the `.xpi` file, and it should add to your browser with no
problem. Chrome instructions coming soon!

# Features
 - When you play a video, the site will remember it and when you load the site again, that video
 will be auto selected. This helps you keep your last spot, and saves you a bit of time.
 - Autoplays the next video on the list!

# Coming Soon/Wishlist
 - Chrome Extension (should be an easy port)
 - Settings Menu (to toggle the various features)

Please let me know in a Github Issue if you have any suggestions!
